# SpaceInvaders  

Basic Space Invaders. Created using the game engine I designed through the semester, which was made using Java and Processing.  

To run, right click on ServerStart.java in the networking package, and go to Run As > Java Application.  
Right click on Client.java in the networking package, and go to Run As > Java Application.  	
While this game runs with a server client set up, I have no idea what will happen if you actually add the second client gameplay wise. This is because Dr. Roberts said that we just had to support one client for the game. So it runs as a multiplayer game with just one player basically.  
	
To play:  
	Use the right arrow to move right, and the left arrow to move left.  
	Use the spacebar to shoot bullets. There is a cooldown on the turret. It will go quicker if you release the spacebar instead of
	holding it down.  
	If an enemy collides with you, the game will restart.  
	If you kill all enemies, the game will restart.
